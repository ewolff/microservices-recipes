# Introduction

This brochure introduces the terms *microservice* and *self-contained
system*. It continues with an overview of different concepts and
recipes for the implementation of microservices. The recipe metaphor
expresses that the text describes each approach *in practical terms*. For
each recipe one *example implementation* is provided. Readers
must combine *several* recipes for their projects, as they would need
to do for the menu of a multi-course meal. And finally, there are
*variations and alternatives* for every recipe. *Experiments* invite
you to get hands-on experience with the examples.

The code for the examples can be found on Github. There is also an
[overview](http://ewolff.com/microservices-demos.html), which briefly
explains all the 
demos in this brochure and a few additional ones.

A detailed presentation of the recipes and other concepts around
microservices can be found in the book
[Microservices - A Practical Guide](http://practical-microservices.com/).

## Acknowledgement

I would like to thank everyone with whom I discussed microservices, who
asked me questions or worked with me. There are far too many
to name them all. The discussions help a lot and are a lot of fun!

Many of the ideas and also the implementations are unthinkable without
my colleagues at INNOQ.

Special thanks go to Jörn Hameister for the extensive feedback on the German
edition of this brochure!
