# Introduction

This brochure introduces the terms microservice and Self-contained
System. It continues with an overview of different concepts and
recipes for Implementation of microservices. The recipe metaphor
expresses that the text describes each approach *practically*. For
each recipe one *Implementation as an example* is available.  Readers
must combine *several* recipes for their projects, as they would need
to do for a menu of a multi-course meal. And finally there are
*variations and alternatives* for every recipe. *Experiments* invite
you to get hands-on experience with the examples.

The code for the examples is on Github. There is a [Overview]
(http://ewolff.com/microservices-demos.html), which explains every
demo in the brochure and a few others briefly.

A detailed presentation of the recipes and other concepts around
Microservices can be found in the 
[Microservices - The Practical Guide] (http://practical-microservices.com/).

## Acknowledgement

I would like to thank everyone with whom I discuss microservices, who
asked me questions or worked with me. There are far too many
to name them all. The discussions help a lot and are good fun!

Many of the ideas and also the implementations are unthinkable without
my colleagues at INNOQ .

Thanks to JÃ¶rn Hameister for the extensive feedback about the German
edition of this brochure!
